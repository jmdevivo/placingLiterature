				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in the earlier blogpost, Lake Superior dominates the Twin Ports landscape.  One of the most defining landmarks in Duluth is the Areal Lift Bridge.  The ships that come into and leave the harbor have to pass under the bridge (unless they go through the Superior entry, and those photos will be posted another day).  On summer days, Canal Park, at the base of the Areal Lift Bridge is full of people watching the ships &#8211; some big &#8220;lakers,&#8221; bulk carriers mostly over 730 feet with wide bows , and &#8220;salties,&#8221; the ocean-going ships that are shorter and taller in the middle with more narrow bows.  One of the most familiar sounds is the Captain&#8217;s Salute &#8211; one long blast, followed by two short &#8211; it&#8217;s how the captains of the ships and the bridge greet each other.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our last post, Andrew talked about how community is reflected in the stories about New Haven.  I’ll talk about how the Twin Ports of Duluth-Superior on Lake Superior are reflected in the books we’ve chosen.</p>
<p>Duluth-Superior is the largest port on the Great Lakes.  Located at the far western-end of the Lakes, coal, grain, sugar beets and taconite are shipped from the port.  The East End of Duluth, along the shore of the Big Lake, is the location of the historic mansions of the titans of the turn-of-the-century industries – iron and timber.  The St. Louis River was once lined with sawmills and choked with logs.  Fishing has also always played a big part of the economy and culture.  The Twin Ports are very connected to nature and very dependent on their natural resources.  The Ojibwe settled at the west end of Lake Superior, where food grows on the water (wild rice).</p>
<p>I drive to Duluth-Superior quite often from Milwaukee.  Once you get north of Eau Claire, there are a lot of trees and not a lot of people.  After driving about 2.5 hours on US 53, you go over a big hill before getting to US 2.  On that big hill, you see Lake Superior spread out before you and a cities in the distance.  This picture of the Twin Ports…on the edge of the wilderness where Lake Superior dominates the landscape is reflected in the literature.</p>
<p>Barton Sutter describes his connection with Lake Superior, “One of the many pleasures of living in Duluth is that you have to look at the lake a lot. You might only mean to get some groceries or a hammer from the hardware store, but on your way you see something so grand, so terrible and so beautiful, that you absorb your daily requirement of humility just by driving down the street.”</p>
<p>The themes that come up over and over again in the books set in the Twin Ports are isolation and the power of Lake Superior.  Gitchi Gumi (Big Lake) is so big and ever-present that she often is a character in the stories.  She provides food, transportation and jobs for those who live near her.  The climate is harsh and her moods change, which contributes to her mystery and power.</p>
<p>The experience of living on Lake Superior is so unique, that it is difficult to describe.  For example, in the last two weeks, in the last half of April, there have been three snowstorms, with some locations getting 2.5 feet of snow.  The stories help give a glimpse into the isolation of living in such a unique place, but also the spirit and resilience of the community that has developed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the half-way point of our pilot project, and it’s exciting to see that a few trends are emerging. </p>
<p>The New Haven based novels are falling into one of two camps. They’re either about a blue-collar kid coming to study at Yale and having trouble fitting in with the Ivy League elitist crowd or they’re a gritty murder mystery that takes place in the city’s industrial neighborhoods. Far from cliché, these two categories of novels make sense given the history and demographics of the city, and it’s natural for the city’s literature to reflect this.</p>
<p>New Haven used to be an industrial town. Erector sets were manufactured here as well as boilers, machinery and other industrial goods. Then, as it did elsewhere in New England, manufacturing moved out of the town and took jobs with it. Much of the city fell into disrepair as old factories and warehouses stood vacant. Job loss led to poverty which led to crime. New Haven started cropping up on those “Most Dangerous Cities” lists, and the city got a reputation as a tough town.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yale University and Yale Hospital grew in both size and stature. Empty lots around the green were gobbled up, dorms and academic buildings were built, and downtown New Haven, once a commercial center, became an extension of the Yale community.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like a social scientist, a huge disparity grew between the Ivy League Yalies who thrived in the post-industrial economy and local New Havenites who struggled. The two distinct communities that grew side-by-side (but not necessarily in tandem) has resulted in two distinct types of novels written about New Haven.</p>
<p>Our project deals with the role of geography in literature, and we’ve hit upon a very obvious example of a single location (the city of New Haven) inspiring art in very different ways. Other trends have started to emerge in other cities, and we look forward to discussing those in this space.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last post about crowdsourcing, we talked about the fact that crowdsourcing really transfers some of the power of placemaking to those who are making the place. Here at  <i>Placing Literature</i>, we are all about that kind of culture change.</p>
<p>Something that we need to keep in mind, that like any technology or culture change, there is the potential for conflict.  What happens when the crowd challenges the norm?</p>
<p>That brings us to <i>Duluth is Horrible</i>.</p>
<p>Duluth is seriously NOT horrible, but that is the name of a film by Vincent Gargiulo.  Vincent Gargiulo is a filmmaker from San Francisco who had the idea for a film – a lonely-hearts kind of tale.  He had the film title in mind…(insert community name) is Horrible.  But, he did not have a title until it came to him in a dream.  Duluth.  Duluth is Horrible.</p>
<p>Enter crowdsourcing, stage right.  The film idea was pitched on Kickstarter – a crowdsourcing funding site for arts projects – and funding was secured.  So, now Vincent Gargiulo is in Duluth to make a film called <i>Duluth is Horrible.</i></p>
<p>How do Duluthians feel about this development?  As you might imagine, feelings are mixed.  There are those who welcome any effort to spread the name of Duluth.  There are those who are deeply offended that people would pick on their community.  The social scientist in me points to the fact that some of the funding came from Duluth, local actors are participating and Perfect Duluth Day is talking about the film.  </p>
<p>One blogger in Duluth stated, “With several <a title="Duluth is Horrible Kickstarter" href="http://www.perfectduluthday.com/2012/12/11/duluth-is-horrible-kickstarter/">filmmakers</a> coming to Duluth and <a title="Duluth: A new film by Nicole Brending" href="http://www.perfectduluthday.com/2012/09/27/duluth-a-new-film-by-nicole-brending/">making films</a> which extol the … er … um <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ll_Like_My_Mother">grittier</a> nature of our fair city, I’ve come to wonder if we aren’t letting others define how others see us with their films.”</p>
<p>Good question.  The conflict of crowdsourcing – losing control of an image?  Potential damage from outsiders creating a definition for your community?</p>
<p>More on this in future posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After much deliberation we’ve narrowed our reading list to 15 works of fiction that take place in three cities. We wanted to select books that had a strong sense of setting and included scenes that take place in real physical locations such as Modern Pizza in New Haven, Duluth’s Areal Lift Bridge and Union Square in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The cities were chosen because they represent very distinct settings—each endowed with a very different sense of place. New Haven is a New England town, settled by Puritans and home to an Ivy League institution, and has recently undergone some revitalization. San Francisco is a large city with distinct neighborhoods and home to some of the social movements that have defined life in American culture. The Twin Ports of Duluth-Superior on the shores of Lake Superior has a history of mining, logging and shipping and is a region that lives very close to nature. Each city has its own history, physical features and vibrant arts community.</p>
<p>After these initial 15 books are added to the Placing Literature database we’ll open up data entry to the public, relying on crowdsourcing to build a powerful research tool for geographers, scholars and book lovers the world over.</p>
<p>How is our list? Did we miss an obvious choice?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crowdsourcing matters because it provides some the conditions that enable and encourage participation in civil society  &#8211; a forum, structure, permission, anonymity (to combat fear of rejection), and a cause to which to contribute.  It does not matter if someone is documenting public restrooms in Manhattan, sharing road closures in an open mapping program, cleaning-up a Wikipedia page – there is a place to contribute personal wisdom and have it accepted.  This power shift has implications – historically, our references maps, encyclopedias travel guides – have been drafted by “experts.” Crowdsourcing turns the tables and assumes we are all experts.  The number of potential applications is limitless!  (We will explore some of the applications in future posts.)</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is based on the idea of the collective intelligence – that information is collected, aggregated and vetted by the crowd.  It started as a business strategy to solicit unique solutions to problems.  Businesses, like Netflix and Threadless, would issue a proposal with specific rules and goals, and a reward would be given to the winning proposal.</p>
<p>While initially a business application, crowdsourcing can be helpful in settings where public input is considered important.  The reward would be significantly different, instead of a material “prize,” it would be the opportunity to contribute to a cause or effort in a meaningful way.  One of the biggest challenges facing public officials is getting the public to participate.  Some would think that an invitation to participate in a meeting would be enough to solicit participation, but that is not always the case.  The barriers include the inconvenient time or place, feelings of intimidation in the company of experts, feelings that their participation is perfunctory, and cultural differences.  </p>
<p>It’s the breaking-down of some (definitely not all) of the barriers that makes crowdsourcing is very interesting and holds so much promise.  Crowdsourcing creates conditions that enable the public to actively engage with and define public spaces. </p>
<p>In the case of <i>Placing Literature</i>, information will be collected on the web and aggregated through a Google Map application, with an option of adding photos. People will get to describe the places they read about – which is one of the key components of “placemaking.”  According to the Project for Public Spaces, placemaking involves “looking at, listening to, and asking questions of the people who live, work and play in a particular space, to discover their needs and aspirations.”</p>
<p>We hope that we are offering a tool to help people see not only the scenes (places) they read about in literature, but a structure to help describe the physical places important to them.  The hope is people will have the means to describe their neighborhoods and public spaces, but also their needs and aspirations for those spaces.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A big part of our Placing Literature project is going to rely on crowdsourcing, the idea that a large group of people will volunteer their time for the common good. In this case, we’ll be asking book lovers to plot on a map their favorite scenes from literature that take place in real, physical locations. Nothing too time intensive. Just, if someone is reading a novel and recognizes a setting, we’d ask that they spend five minutes inputting some data in a database about the scene and what the setting means to them.</p>
<p>A lot of other, successful web sites rely on crowdsourcing—wikipedia and urban dictionary are two examples. We hope to tap into the passion readers have about books to product a living document that everyone can enjoy and share.</p>
<p>I recently ran across a great RSAnimation video that talks about motivation and the crowdsourcing phenomenon. The speaker even suggests that a sense of purpose is more of a motivator than monetary rewards, and has a lot of studies to back up his assertion. What motivates you?</p>
<p>Check out the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=u6XAPnuFjJc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=u6XAPnuFjJc</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Setting is a vital component to any work of literature—from Charles Dickens’s London to Mark Twain’s Hannibal to Jack Kerouac’s Lowell. Putting a story in the context of a real physical location gives stories context, placing readers in a familiar locale as the story unfolds around them. More than mere coincidence, many locations around the world act as the setting in multiple works of literature—yet the stories that take place there differ wildly.</p>
<p>But, what are these scenes? They are places. Geographers understand places as more than a point on the earth’s surface represented on a map. A place is also a locale—or a setting where lives unfold and daily interactions happen.  In this project, we are most concerned with the <i>sense of place</i>, or the meanings, values and emotions attached to a space. Particularly, in this case, the meanings and values created by the author and experienced by the reader.</p>
<p>We started thinking about these scenes, these places. How are they constructed? What does that mean for the reader? What can the reader do with that information and experience of place? We hope that our methodology of analyzing how authors construct place and how that place shapes the stories will empower readers to engage with places—the places in the stories, as well as their own places.</p>
<p>So, please stay tuned.  We will be updating this blog regularly with project developments, reflections and other random ideas.  Please feel free to comment and share your ideas, we&#8217;ll need them all.</p>
<p>-Andrew and Katie</p>
