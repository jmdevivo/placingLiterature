Server for PlacingLiterature

This repo contains the code for a pretty recent version of the site at PlacingLiterature.com.

Placing Literature is a crowd-sourced database of real-world locations from literature. 
It is an attempt to examine the connection between real-world places and the stories they inspire.
The data is presented on a map which can be explored or updated.

Users are encouraged to log in and add content about the books they've read or places they've been.
As scenes are added status updates about this content are posted to twitter.com/placinglit.

The application is a Google AppEngine application written in Python.
The front-end uses BackboneJS and Google Maps for Javascript.
Tweets are posted to twitter using the twitter-python framework from @sixohsix.

In addition to data added via the map interface Placing Literature also presents data from similar sites as well as book and author data from crowd-sourced databases.
