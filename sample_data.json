In those days, the Ningy Ningy people of Redcliffe and Toorbul lived a traditional life, hunting and fishing as their forefathers had done before them for thousands of years. The first half of this novel describes their life. Matthew Flinders noted the names of three of the people, Yelbah, Bomaringo and Yewoo and these are taken as the main characters in this book. Their lives changed in 1823 when they welcomed the three castaways, Thomas Pamphlett, Richard Parsons and John Finnegan, who had been blown off course in a storm. These men had been collecting cedar for the Sydney Penal Colony and were eventually thrown ashore at Moreton Island. After many privations, they arrived at present day Redcliffe where they lived with the Aboriginals of the Ningy Ningy clan for three months. Later they lived with the Joondoobarrie clan on Bribie Island where they were rescued by John Oxley in November of the same year. The Red Cliffs is a historical novel which describes the interaction of the Ningy Ningy and Joondoobarrie people with these three castaways before they were rescued and when Pamphlett returned as a convict at the Moreton Bay Penal settlement in 1827. The convicts were viewed as outcasts of their society, just as the tallabilla were outcasts of the Aboriginal society. The red cliffs were known as the cliffs of running blood, or Kau-in Kau-in, by the Aboriginal people and these cliffs witnessed the shedding of the blood of the convicts and of their people.", "image_url": null, "scenetime": null, "user_email": "webmanager@slq.qld.gov.au", "db_key": 5708664371412992, "ts": "2014-03-27 03:24:56.640396", "checkins": 0, "symbols": null, "location": {"longitude": 153.108256, "latitude": -27.229741}, "notes": "", "scenelocation": "Redcliffe", "title": "The red cliffs : a story of Moreton Bay 1799-1830"}, {"author": "Jean-Dominique Bauby", "actors": null, "scenedescription": "The day before his stroke, Bauby stops at his office, speaks with Simone V, former minister of health, doing damage control over a badly executed photo, and attends a boring lunch.", "image_url": null, "scenetime": null, "user_email": "tglong1@gmail.com", "db_key": 5709763883040768, "ts": "2013-11-29 17:07:45.379120", "checkins": 0, "symbols": null, "location": {"longitude": 2.35107421875, "latitude": 48.87555444355432}, "notes": "The 43-year-old Bauby was editor of the French edition of Elle magazine.", "scenelocation": "Offices of Elle magazine, Levallois-Perret cedex", "title": "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"}, {"author": "Sandy L.

He describes it as 'a town at the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria in what is known as the Gulf Country. The town was much larger fifty years ago than it is now; at the time of the gold-mining boom it had about twenty-five hotels - probably more drinking shops, most of them - but now it has only two. There are about eighty permanent white residents there counting men, women, and children, and a floating population of two or three hundred blacks who live in deplorable conditions in iron shanties outside the town. The place is about two hundred miles from Cloncurry and five hundred by air from Cairns and Townsville on the coast. It has a hospital staffed by a couple of nursing sisters, and it has a house for a doctor though no doctor has ever been induced to practice there...'

But there was no sound, no rumble of an explosion. William was aware of the smell of burning ... but it was a good smell, a familiar smell. The smell of grass, of wheat, of the farm itself. His father dead by fire and his mother plagued by demons of her own, William is cast upon the charity of his unknown uncle --an embittered old man encamped in the ruins of a once great station homestead, Kuran House. It's a baffling and sinister new world for the boy, a place of decay and secret histories. His uncle is obsessed by a long life of decline and by a dark quest for revival, his mother is desperate for a wealth and security she has never known, and all their hopes it seems come to rest upon William's young shoulders. But as the past and present of Kuran Station unravel and merge together, the price of that inheritance may prove to be the downfall of them all.
