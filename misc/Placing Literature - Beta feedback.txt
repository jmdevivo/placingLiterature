Hi Steve,
 
Great talking to you this afternoon. Below is the feedback we discussed on the call. We’d love to see a Charlie version by the end of the month with the goal of completing the project by the end of February.
 
Also, we’d like to send half your payment immediately—with the rest delivered upon project completion. Please send your mailing address ASAP.
 
Thankb -/'.........................''º“«πª[py56784EQW$%
